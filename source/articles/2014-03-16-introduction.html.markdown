In this blog I plan to share interesting things that I find. Given my interests this will probably be limited to:

- Logic
- Programming
- Emacs
- Math
- Puzzles
- Politics
- My Family

Although, I’ll probably also post links to interesting things that I find on the internet.

I’m also hoping to post some of my half finished ideas. I think more clearly when I write. I’d like to take advantage of that to work through the things bouncing around in my head.

My fear is that I won’t maintain this blog, I’ll get busy with other projects. I plan to use links to interesting things to bridge the gap when I don’t have time to write. We’ll see how it goes.
